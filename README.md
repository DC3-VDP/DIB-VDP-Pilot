```A few Requirements:```

- You may read and download the document without an account but you will need a Github account to post a comment. Signing up for a [Github](https://github.com/join) account is free and easy and many of you may already have an account already.
- When posting a comment please include the line numbers(s) you are commenting on in the title of the comment so we can reference and adjudicate the comments for efficiently.
- Github is not a CRM so there will be obvious differences but should  be relatively easy to navigate. Keep in mind that "comments" are called out as "issues" in Github and will be used to describe the processes.



```Instructions on posting a comment:```

1. In the ribbon at the top of the page click on the "Issues" link.

2. After clicking the "Issues" link you will be presented with the "Issues" page. On this page you will see all "issues" posted by all commentators. You will be able to view issues, post on current issues and create your own issues.  You will also be able to open new issues on this page.

3.  Clicking the "New Issue" button will open a template for you to enter you comment into. Remember to include line number(s) when filling this out. Below that you can type a comment into the body on the issue and then finally click the "Submit New Issue" button to post it.

4.  And that's it, you will be retuned to your submitted issue and can be reviewed and commented on at this time. If a commentator wants to make a comment on a posted issue it's just like submitting an issue. There is a field under the comment that can be edited and tracked with other commentators comments. Simply Fill in the field with your comment and click the "Comment" button at the bottom.
