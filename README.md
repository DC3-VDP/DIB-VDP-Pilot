## Welcome!

Welcome to the DIB-VDP Feasibility Study period of comments Git page.  This page will help guide you to view and download as well as how to post a comment. This feasibility study will be running from [date to date] so make sure to comment and comment often before end date.  

```A few Requirements:```

- You may read and download the document without an account but you will need a Github account to post a comment. Signing up for a [Github](https://github.com/join) account is free and easy and many of you may already have an account already.
- When posting a comment please include the line numbers(s) you are commenting on in the title of the comment so we can reference and adjudicate the comments for efficiently.
- Github is not a CRM so there will be obvious differences but should  be relatively easy to navigate. Keep in mind that "comments" are called out as "issues" in Github and will be used to describe the processes.



```Instructions on posting a comment:```

1. In the ribbion at the top of the page click on the "Issues" button.
