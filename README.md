```A few Requirements:```

- You may read and download the document without an account but you will need a Github account to post a comment. Signing up for a [Github](https://github.com/join) account is free and easy and many of you may already have an account.
- Github is not a CRM so there will be obvious differences however you should find it relatively easy to navigate. Keep in mind that "comments" are called out as "issues" in Github and will be used to describe the processes.
- When posting a comment please include the line numbers(s) you are commenting on in the title so we can reference efficiently. To assist in comment adjudication it is helpful to identify the category of the issue as E: Editorial (typographical or grammatical changes) or S: Substantive. Please include how you would change the issue as well as a brief justification statement. These details will expedite the final adjudication process.

```Instructions on posting a comment:```

1. In the ribbon at the top of the page click on the "Issues" link.

2. After clicking the "Issues" link you will be presented with the "Issues" page. On this page you will see all "issues" posted by all commentators. You will be able to view issues, post on current issues, and create your own issues.  You will also be able to open new issues on this page.

3.  Clicking the "New Issue" button will open a template for you to enter a comment. Remember to include line number(s), E or S category code for each issue, and brief justification (for S comments only). Type a comment into the text box for the issue and click the "Submit New Issue" button to post it.

4.  And that's it, you will be returned to your submitted issue. It can be reviewed and/or commented on by others at this time. If a commentator wants to make a comment on a posted issue it's just like submitting an issue. Use the field under the comment to edit and tracked others comments. Simply fill in the field with your issue and click the "Comment" button at the bottom.
